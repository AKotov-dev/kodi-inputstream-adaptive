InputStream Adaptive add-on for Kodi (RPM for MgaRemix/Mageia-8/9)

Source: https://github.com/xbmc/inputstream.adaptive

TODO's:
---
+ Adaptive bitrate switching has been implemented in Kodi as of v20, but will continue to be developed over time.
+ Automatic / fixed video stream selection depending on max. visible display rect (some work has to be done at the inputstream interface).
+ There will be many MPEG-DASH, HSL or Smooth Stream manifest types currently not supported that must be extended.
  
RPM packages contain add-on for Kodi-19-Matrix (mrx8) and Kodi-20-Nexus (mrx9) needed to watch YouTube and other sources. They were backported from Fedora Rawhide and adapted for Mageia-8 (mrx8) and Mageia-9 (mrx9).
